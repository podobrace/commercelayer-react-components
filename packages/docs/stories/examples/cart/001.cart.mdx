## The cart page
The following example shows how to create a shopping cart page using the components described above.

To better remark the concepts just described, we grouped the components in 3 different sections:
- Line items
- Gift cards and coupons
- Totals

Again, all sections are wrapped inside the same `<OrderContainer>` component, which is the main order context.

<span title="Coupon" type="info">
Use `TEST-COUPON` to add a 10% discount code and see how the totals change.
</span>

<span title="Gift card" type="info">
Use `0513f118-dcc1-4ba5-b5c1-e83b6055ca6a` to add a 100â‚¬ discount and see how the totals change.
</span>

<Canvas of={Stories.Default} />
