# Building a checkout page

This guide will show you how to create a checkout cart page using this library.

Usually a checkout page is structured will the following sections:
- list of items to purchase
- customer details (billing and shipping address forms)
- shipping method selection
- payment method selection
- place order button

You might decide to split the checkout process into multiple pages, but the general it follows the same concept.

We will try to split this guide into pieces and show you how to create each section, but it's important to understand that even if each section is a separate block of components, 
they are all connected to the same `OrderContainer`.

It's also important to understand that shipping methods can't be selected if we don't know the customer shipping address (might be different from the billing address), 
and payment methods can't be selected if we don't know the selected shipping method, since it might affect the total amount of the order.
So the order of the sections is important.

Before jumping to the next section and see how our `react-components` can be used to build a checkout page, we recommend you to read the following article on
