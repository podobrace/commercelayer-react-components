## Shipping method selection
Once we have the customer shipping address we can display the available shipping methods.
The components will only display the available shipping methods for the matched zones found in the customer shipping address.

If the inventory model is configured to split the order into multiple shipments (examples: items available from different warehouses), 
the user will be able to select a shipping method for each shipment and we can use the `<LineItemsContainer>` component
nested inside a `<ShipmentContainer>` component to list the order `line_items` for each shipment.

When a `<LineItemsContainer>` is used inside a shipment context, the list will be filtered based on the items that will be included in that shipment.

<span title='Requirement' type='warning'>
To display shipping methods, the order must have been updated with a shipping address.
Remember that a you can set the shipping address the same as billing (the address will be cloned) or define a different address.

If you are not seeing any shipping methods in the box below, reach the previous step and set a proper address.
In this demo, shipping methods are only available for the following countries: IT, DE, ES, FR, ES and NL.
