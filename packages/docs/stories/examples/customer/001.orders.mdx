## Customer Orders
This guide will explain how to create a customer orders listing page using the Commerce Layer components.

The order list will be rendered as a sortable table, depending on the data you want to display and use as columuns.
You might want to use this component to render a list of user's orders in their account page.

<span title="Requirements" type="warning">
To access the customer scope, we will need to pass to our main `<CommerceLayer>` component the `accessToken` for a logged-in user.

Also, all our components will need to stay inside the `<CustomerContainer>` that will hold the customer context.
  <Source dark code={`
<CommerceLayer accessToken='customer-orders-access-token'>
  <CustomerContainer>
    // customer components that will access the customer context here
  <CustomerContainer />
</CommerceLayer>
  `} language='jsx' />
</span>

### Full example
The list is mainly composed by two components: `OrderList` and `OrderListRow` and works around the `order` object.

- You can specify the `columns` you need to handle using the relative props in `<OrderList>`. Each columns is linked to an attribute of the `order` object.
- Each value is then rendered with a `<OrderListRow>` component, which is a `<td>` element attached to a specific `field` of the order object.

<span title="Rendering custom cell value" type="info">
  `<OrderListRow>` works out the box by automatically render the value of the field in a `<td>` tag, 
  but you can also use `children` prop to customize the output that will be rendered inside the `<td>` tag.
  Just remember that you don't have to write the `<td>` tag, **but only the inner content**.
  <br /><br />
  In the following example you can notice that the `<OrderListRow field='number'>` cell uses a custom children render,
  while content of other cells is rendered with the default values.

<Canvas of={Stories.Default} />
