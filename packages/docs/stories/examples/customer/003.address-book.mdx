## The customer address book

The customer address book is a page that allows to list, create, update and delete addresses related to a customer.
It uses some components we have already seen in the previous examples, such as `CommerceLayer`, `CustomerContainer` and `AddressesContainer`.

The main `CommerceLayer` component is needed to be setup with a valid customer access token in order to be able to read customer information.

Then thanks to the `CustomerContainer` it will be possible to initialize and access the customer context to provide it to children components.

At last the `AddressesContainer` is demanded to setup the addresses related provider and context enabling required management states and methods.

<Source dark code={`
<CommerceLayer accessToken='customer-orders-access-token'>
  <CustomerContainer>
    <AddressesContainer>
      - list of addresses or empty state  (create / edit / delete buttons)
      - address form (for edit and create actions)
    </AddressesContainer>
  <CustomerContainer />
</CommerceLayer>
  `} language='jsx' /> 


### The list of addresses
The list is composed by these components:  `<AddressesEmpty>` (optional), `Address` and `AddressField`.

The `<AddressesEmpty>` component is demanded to show a default or custom message in case any customer address is available.

The `<Address>` component will read customer addresses from the context and will loop over to generate a list of elements to enable their children the ability to focus on one single address object.

Inside the `<Address>` it will be possible to use some `<AddressField>` components to render any requested attribute of an `address` resource.

<span title='Notice' type='info'>
Please note that we don't need to loop though the `addresses` array. The content will be rendered for each address passed to our `<Address>` component.
</span>

To build the list of all saved address, we will use the following structure.
<Source dark code={`
<CommerceLayer accessToken='customer-orders-access-token'>
  <CustomerContainer>
    <AddressesContainer>
      <AddressesEmpty emptyText='No addresses found' />
      <Address>
        // the elements used as children of '<Address>' will be used as template 
        // to list all customer_addresses found in the context
        <AddressField name='first_name' />
        <AddressField name='last_name' />
        <AddressField name='full_address' />
        <AddressField type='edit' label='Edit address' onClick={handleEditAddressForm} />
        <AddressField type='delete' label='Delete address' />
      </Address>
    </AddressesContainer>
  <CustomerContainer />
</CommerceLayer>
  `} language='jsx' /> 


### The address form
The address form is composed by the same set of component we have already seen in the previous step,
with the only difference that it will be used not only to create a new address but also to edit an existing one.

We have already seen how to create a new address.

<span title='Notice' type='info'>
  To edit an existing address we just need to retrieve the `address` object we want to edit 
  and pass each attribute as value for the corresponding `<AddressField>` component.
  Then, to allow the `<SaveAddressesButton>` to update the address we just need to pass the `address.id` as value for the `addressId` prop.
  <br />
  We can get the `address` object to edit from the `<AddressField type='edit' />` component. It will be returned as argument of the `onClick` callback, 
  ready to be stored in an internal React state.
</span>

Example:
<Source dark code={`
const [address, setAddress] = useState<Address | null>(null)

return (
  <AddressesContainer>
    <Address>
      // the onClick will return the address object to edit, so we can store it in an internal state
      <AddressField type='edit' label='Edit address' onClick={(address) => setAddress(address)} />
    </Address>
    {address != null && (
      // form is rendered once we have a valid address in our internal state, so we can pass values to our components 
      <BillingAddressForm>
        <AddressInput name='billing_address_first_name' value={address.first_name} />
        <AddressInput name='billing_address_line_1' value={address.line_1} />

        // addressId will be used to update the address instead of creating a new one
        <SaveAddressesButton label='Save Address' addressId={address.id} /> 
      </BillingAddressForm>
    )}
  </AddressesContainer>
)
`} language='tsx' /> 


### Full code implementation
The example below contains the full working code of the address book page connecting together 
all the blocks described above.

Feel free to add, remove or edit addresses as you are impersonating your customer.
