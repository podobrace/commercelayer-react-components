# Mini Cart
We can combine the two components just described (`<HostedCart>` and `<CartLink>`) to create a mini cart
that will open as a modal on top of the page.

To do so, we need to set the prop `type='mini'` to both components. Try to click the link below to open the mini cart.
<Canvas of={Stories.Basic} />


### Advanced usage
In the previous example we used as `label` prop a simple string, but it can accept any React component (`ReactNode`).

This means we can be creative and mix other components to create a more complex label, like a shopping bag icon
that previews the number of items in the cart.

This icon component can be built using `<LineItemsContainer>` and `<LineItemsCount>` and a custom svg icon.

<Source dark code={`
const MyCartIcon = () => (
  <div className='relative inline-block cursor-pointer text-xs font-bold'>
    <LineItemsContainer>

     {/* static icon */}
      <svg
        xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'
        width='36'
        height='36'
        fill='currentColor'
        viewBox='0 0 256 256'
      >
        <path d='M216,64H176a48,48,0,0,0-96,0H40A16,16,0,0,0,24,80V200a16,16,0,0,0,16,16H216a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80A16,16,0,0,0,216,64ZM128,32a32,32,0,0,1,32,32H96A32,32,0,0,1,128,32Zm88,168H40V80H80V96a8,8,0,0,0,16,0V80h64V96a8,8,0,0,0,16,0V80h40Z' />
      </svg>

      {/* total number of cart items */}
      <LineItemsCount className='absolute bottom-2 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2' />
      
    </LineItemsContainer>
  </div>
)
`} language='jsx' />
 
Now we can use our custom component as `label` prop of `<CartLink>` to create a mini cart that can be 
placed in the top navigation of your site.

<span title='One context' type='info'>
This works because `LineItemsContainer` and `HostedCart` are both using the same order context: 
they are both inside the same `<OrderContainer>` component.
</span>

Click on the icon to show the side cart modal.
<Canvas of={Stories.WithCartIcon} />
