# useCommerceLayer

The `useCommerceLayer` hook is a React hook that provides access to the CommerceLayer JS SDK,
giving you the opportunity to use an already initialized instance of our official SDK client in your React application.


<span title="What is the Commerce Layer JS SDK?" type="info">
It is a JavaScript Library wrapper that makes it quick and easy to interact with the Commerce Layer API.
You can read more about this and see some examples by checking its [official documentation](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-sdk) on GitHub.
</span>

By accessing the SDK instance through the hook, you can fetch resources, create new ones, update or delete them, and so on.
Of course it will be limited to the scope of the `accessToken` used to initialize the main `<CommerceLayer>` component.

**Example**: if you are using an access token for a `sales_channel` (guest) that has access to a single market, you will be able to fetch only resources (like prices) related to that market.
Or if your access token belongs to a signed-in customer (customer token), you will be able to update only the addresses associated to that customer.

<span title="Requirements" type="warning">
Must be used inside a `<CommerceLayer>` component.
</span>


## Usage

This hook returns an object that can be destructured to access an instance of the `sdkClient` function.

You can then use it to call the CommerceLayer JS SDK methods, such as:
- `sdkClient().skus.list()`
- `sdkClient().skus.retrieve('BABYONBU000000E63E7412MX')`
- `sdkClient().addresses.update({ id: 'abcdefgh', first_name: 'John' })`

Please note that the `sdkClient()` function might not always exist, this because it needs to access the React context that could also be `undefined`.
So it's always better to check if the returned function is defined before using it.

<Source dark code={`
if (sdkClient != null) {
  sdkClient().skus.list()
} 
// or
sdkClient()?.skus.list()
`} />


The following example shows how to use the hook to fetch a filtered list of SKUs. 
<Source dark code={`
import { useCommerceLayer } from "@commercelayer/react-components"

const { sdkClient } = useCommerceLayer()

if (sdkClient == null) {
  return null
}

return (
  <button onClick={async () => { 
      const skus = await sdkClient().skus.list({ filters: { code_cont: 'TSHIRT000' } })
    }}
  >
    Fetch specific SKU code
  </button>
)
`} language='jsx' />
 
As you can see, the `sdkClient` methods to list, retrieve, update or delete a resource are all async functions that return always a Promise.
